Code to accompany machine learning talk given at USF on Jan 26, 2018

The directory ```kdd99``` applies XGBoost and tensorflow to a simplified version of the freely available kdd99 dataset. It also gives an example of reading CSV files into tensorflow using both ```tf.data.TextLineDataset
``` and ```tf.data.TFRecordDataset```. For details, see the README in that directory.

The directory ```hapt``` applies XGBoost and tensorflow to version one of the freely available UCI HAPT dataset. It is an example of using tensorboard with LSTMs.
