This code implements an LSTM with Tensorflow using the Inference-Loss-Training pattern.

## Getting Started

To get started, train the default model

```python
cd hapt

python train_model.py
```

or modify parameters of the model before training. For details see:

```python
cd hapt

python train_model.py --help
